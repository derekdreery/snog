# snog

This crate provides a wrapper for vello that adheres to the KISS philosophy.

## Non-goals

- Do everything that vello does - if you want that then use vello!

Having said that, if you want a feature that isn't implemented, and you can implement it in a
way that is *simple to use*, then feel free to PR.

## Name

The word 'snog' is as an informal name for a sloppy kiss in the UK. The code in the crate may
or may not be sloppy.
